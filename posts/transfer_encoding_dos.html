		<h1>Transfer-Encoding HTTP DoS</h1>
		<p>
			Transfer-Encoding Denial Of Service is a technique where the attacker abuses the HTTP protocol's Transfer-Encoding header<br>
			to launch a Denial Of Service attack. All the attacker has to do is to craft a specific HTTP request like the one below and<br>
			send it to their target:<br>
			
			<div class="content-box">
			POST /some-endpoint HTTP/1.1<br>
			Host: example.com<br>
			Transfer-Encoding: chunked<br><br>
			
			10\r\n<br>
			HGSXCZSQNP\r\n
			</div><br>
			
			This will allow the server and client to stream chunk encoded responses to each other until the terminating chunk is provided.<br>
			The terminating chunk is a chunk which contains a zero followed by a carriage return and a newline.<br><br>
		
			Let's say the attacker sends the same chunk we saw in the request above per minute:<br><br>
			
			<div class="content-box">			
			10\r\n<br>
			HGSXCZSQNP\r\n
			</div><br>
			
			This will force the server to hold the connection open as it waits for the terminating chunk, which the<br>
			attacker never provides.<br><br>

			Transfer-Encoding Denial Of Service is a variant of the R.U.D.Y. (R U Dead Yet?) attack, but rather depends on<br>
			any endpoint accepting the Transfer-Encoding header rather than just pure web form data.<br><br>
			
			Although such an attack may be effective against HTTP servers, HTTP servers running HTTP 2, 3 or later<br>
			are protected against this attack as the Transfer-Encoding header is disallowed and any request depending on<br>
			it will be provided with a protocol error.
