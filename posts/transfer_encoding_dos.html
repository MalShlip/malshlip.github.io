		<h1>Transfer-Encoding HTTP DoS</h1>
		<p>
			Transfer-Encoding HTTP Denial Of Service is a technique where the attacker abuses<br>
			the HTTP protocol's (Transfer-Encoding) header to launch a Denial Of Service attack.<br>
			All the attacker has to do is to craft a specific HTTP request like the one below and send it:<br>
			
			<div class="content-box">
			POST /some-endpoint HTTP/1.1<br>
			Host: example.com<br>
			Transfer-Encoding: chunked<br><br>
			
			10\r\n<br>
			HGSXCZSQNP\r\n
			</div><br>
			
			This will make the server's endpoint wait for chunked responses until the end chunk is provided.<br>
			The end chunk is a chunk which contains a zero followed by a carriage return and a newline.<br><br>
		
			Let's say the attacker sends the same chunk we saw in the request above per minute:<br><br>
			
			<div class="content-box">			
			10\r\n<br>
			HGSXCZSQNP\r\n
			</div><br>
			
			This will force the server to hold the connection open as it waits for the end chunk, which the<br>
			attacker never provides.<br><br>
			
			This also allows for low and slow attacks as the attacker can wait extremely long intervals<br>
			before submitting the next chunk while never providing the end chunk.<br><br>
			
			Transfer-Encoding HTTP Denial Of Service does NOT work on the HTTP 2 and 3 protocols as the Transfer-Encoding header<br>
			is disallowed.
