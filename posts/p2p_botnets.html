		<h1>IPv6 Peer-To-Peer Botnets</h1>
		<p>
		We are usually used to this representation of P2P botnets:<br>
		
		<img src="p2p_botnet_figure_1.png" alt="p2p botnet figure"><br>
		
		Now there are lots of issues with this model, especially with IPv4. BUT...<br>
		since the IPv6 protocol is just getting more and more adopted into networking infrastructure,<br>
		this model may actually be slightly correct. Because of the issue with IPv4 not having<br>
		enough space to assign an IP address to all devices on the internet, we invented NAT and<br> 
		later IPv6. NAT works by assigning a private IP address to a device on a local<br>
		network, this assigning process is done by a router which then forwards traffic from that device<br>
		via its own public IP address to the internet. This removes the need for all devices<br>
		to have their own public IP addresses which fixes the IPv4 spacing issue. IPv6 was another<br>
		solution, rather than to use 32 bit addresses IPv6 uses 128 bit addresses which<br>
		increased available space by a lot (2^128 to be exact). Since IPv6 provides the<br>
		device with a public IP address, it bypasses the need to configure port forwarding<br>
		manually via router settings (or UPnP, etc.) to expose a device's service to the internet.<br>
		Botnet operators and attackers can and have abused IPv6 for this exact purpose, to bypass NAT restrictions for P2P<br>
		infrastructure and command & control.<br><br>
		
		Although a strict firewall may be able to block specific ports and suspicious traffic,<br>
		I have noticed that attackers cleverly get around this by literally just configuring the<br>
		firewall themselves via some stupid powershell or netsh.exe, but since this requires administrative<br>
		privileges an attacker still needs to find a way to elevate themselves which they usually do anyway.<br><br>
		
		IPv6 is a good protocol and me myself is looking forward to its growth, but because IPv6 still is a new<br>
		kid on the block I would recommend disabling it if you don't really need it for your own security.
